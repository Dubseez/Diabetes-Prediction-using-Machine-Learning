# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

The Diabetes Prediction project aims to assess a patient's risk of diabetes using machine learning models trained on health-related metrics. By analyzing features like glucose levels, BMI, age, and family history, the system predicts the likelihood of diabetes onset.
